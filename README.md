# liri-node-app

In this assignment, I made LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI is a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

Liri will return data from twitter, spotify, and from the OMDB API. 

Since there is no front end for this application, there is no frontend link.
